# Smart-Car-Parking-System
This Parking system contains a web panel for admin which was developed using HTML, CSS, Java script, Php and android application which was developed using Java and Android Studio. The main objective of this project was to educate users for the availability of parking space.
We have developed a system where users can find information for car parking and its a availability. This system in future can be linked with a payment getaway that can enable users to pay and book their parking slot.
